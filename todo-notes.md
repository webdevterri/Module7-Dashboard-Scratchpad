# To DO List & Notes

- [ ] Change the text shadow (a lot of images are light so it needs to be a little darker)
- [ ] Add link to Unsplash author's profile
- [ ] Can change the current time to short to get rid of the seconds, if you want
- [ ] Test in regular browser. If bg image is taking to long to load, switch from raw size to large or maybe regular.
- [ ] Write a Readme.md file to talk about the original project and what I added to customize the dashboard
- [ ] Take screenshot or screenrecording to show the app in action. Link to it in Readme and my portfolio (if this is a project I include.)

## Ideas to customize
- [ ] Add current times from around the world (Japan)
- [ ] Make the weather a larger block showing the entire week or the next few days or "Feels Like"
- [ ] Find other APIs to integrate (Twitter, news feeds, Stock market, etc.)
- [ ] Add more info from CoinGecko (Bitcoin, Polygon, Monero, etc.)
